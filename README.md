# Restaurant Reviews

Restaurant Reviews app is a three stage course project for **Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course**. Goal is to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

This is the Google Developer Scholarship Challenge - Mobile Web Specialist track.
I have been selected for a phase 2: full scholarship in the Google Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program.
In phase 1 there was 3-months access to Offline Web Applications with support from Udacity mentors.
Built next-generation and responsive web applications and grew as a developer.
Top 1,000 students from the Intermediate Track were awarded with scholarships to the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program.

## Project Overview

In **Stage One**, need take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users. 
In **Stage Two**, need to implement web service requests to get real data from service, store those data in IndexedDB to be available in offline mode too. Meet specififations for site performance. Lighthouse targets for each category exceed: 
* Progressive Web App: >90
* Performance: >70
* Accessibility: >90
In **Stage Three**, ... (I am not yet started it, will update it later)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To launch app on your local machine you will need any Web Server which can host your local files.
For example, [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb).

Need a running Node.js and npm versions. Currently I am using Node v8.9.1 and npm v5.8.0.

If you want to modify and test task files for example, gulpfile.js, you will need a [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) and/or [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).

### Installing

Run your local server to host web app. 
Those steps are different for different web server.
With your server running, visit the site: `http://{host}:{port}`, `host` and `port` variables you can find somewhere in Web Server console or settings.

To run Node web server:
* install [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* go to ./server directory
* run `npm install` to install dependencies
* run `npm install sails@0.12.13 --save` to install necessary Sails version for project
* start the server `node server`
